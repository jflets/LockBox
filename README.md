1.  Existing User Login: If you are an existing user, you will be prompted to enter your username. After entering your username, you will be asked to provide your master password. Enter your master password without displaying the input. If the entered master password matches the stored master password, you will be logged in successfully.

2.  New User Account Creation: If you are a new user, you will be asked to create a new account. Enter your desired username and create a master password. Confirm the master password to ensure accuracy. The application will create a new account and store your master password securely.
